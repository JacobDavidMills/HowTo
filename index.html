      <h1>How to Style your Hair. </h1> <!-- Used h1 tag here. -->
      <p>You may think that I was born this stunningly handsome. 
      You would be wrong. It takes a lot of work, styling, and product
      to keep looking my best. This is just for guys, but if you're a woman, 
      you might learn something too. For the next three paragraphs I will tell you
      my tricks on how to look your best. </p>

      <h2>The Wet It and Comb It Method.</h2> <!-- Used h2 tag here. -->
      <p> For this method you only need a comb and water. You start by wetting 
      a comb, a rag, or just take a shower. The only thing that matters is that 
      you have wet hair. Make sure that you really wet it down, and that nothing is left 
      dry on your head. Then take a comb to it. Style it with a comb, and 
      make sure that you do it in a way that makes your girlfriend happy.
      If you don't have a girlfriend, you can always ask your <i>mother</i> <!-- Used i tag here. -->if it looks good.
      She has told me in the past, <q>No! You should go try again.</q><!-- Used q tag here. -->
      Just a forewarning, <b>she may be partial to a certain style</b><!-- Used b tag here. -->, but you are well
      on you way to looking your best.</p><!-- Used p tag here. -->

       <h2>The Hair Gel Method.</h2>
       <p>The plane water method works, but if you have slightly longer hair you 
       must do more in order to look your best. You will need the following.
       <h3>Things needed:</h3> <!-- Used h3 tag here. -->
    <ul class="square">
      <li>Rag or something to get your hair wet</li><!-- Used li tag here. -->
      <li>A Comb</li>
      <li>Hair Gel </li>
    </ul><!-- Used ul tag here. -->
       <b>You start off exactly the same as before.</b>
       You first wet your hair and them comb it. Then you need get out your hair gell.
       All you have to do is squirt about a teaspoon into your hands. After that, rub
       your hands together and then rub your hair. After you have thoroughly rubbed 
       your hair, comb it again. Make sure that you are quick. If you are not, you may leave in lumps.
       Now some people use hair gel everyday. If it is super strong, I wouldn't. 
       You can really damage your hair. If you must style your hair daily, I have
       the product for you. It's called, <b><i>Tea Tree</i></b>, it moisturizes and
       even helps eliminate dandruff. If you wish to buy some,

       <h2> The Hairspray Method.</h2> <img src="https://jacobdavidmills.github.io/HowTo/images/barber%20good%20(1).png" id="ad">
       <p>This method is the simplest of the three, but you need a few things.You will need a comb, something to wet your hair, and hairspray. 
       First, like always, you wet your hair. You then must take out hairspray.
    You must spray it heavily and all over your hair. If you miss a spot, 
    it will stick up and out. Then, once you spray your hair, comb it into position.
    You only have a few minutes to do this. Hopefully, you style it well, and 
    all of the cute girls fall in love with you.

       <h2> Conclusion </h2>    

       <p> Now you have learned all that I have to teach you. You can comb your 
       hair with just water, gel, or hairspray. All three of these methods have
       worked for me in the past, and they may not work for you. All that you
       have to do is try, and you will find the method that works best for you. Make sure that you get combing!</p>
